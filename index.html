        <h2 id="something-new">Deciding to try something new</h2>
        <h5>April 11, 2024 - 2 PM</h5>
        <p>I made a service request on the help portal, asking for Blender to be installed on my laptop. At the time, I thought it's not possible. In fact, I always wanted to play around with Blender, but I just can't install it myself.</p>
        
        <h2 id="first-timer">First timer</h2>
        <h5>April 12, 2024 - 8 AM</h5>
        <p>Blender suddenly appeared on my start menu at this time! Thanks to Mr. Peters at the tech room, he pushed out Blender 4.1 to my computer.</p>
        
        <h2 id="noob-struggle">Struggles of a noob</h2>
        <h5>April 12, 2024 - 9 AM</h5>
        <p>Checked out Blender real quick, but I then found out that everything feels so weird. I don't know any shortcut, not even how to create a new object. I felt a bit down. They said Blender is easy to learn, but why does it look so confusing?</p>
        
        <h2 id="from-scratch">Time to start from scratch</h2>
        <h5>April 12, 2024 - 11 AM</h5>
        <p>I started watching Andrew Price's Blender channel in my free time, and there's a video designed for complete Blender noobs like me. It explained the most used features like creating and moving stuffs, setting up a simple environment, and the Cycles renderer. That video turned out to be quite useful!</p>

        <h5>April 12, 2024 - 1 PM</h5>
        <p>The basic shape of my donut is done, with icing. Sprinkles will come later at the decoration section... anyways I watched three tutorials just to reach this part. Each of them are about 20 mins.</p>
        
        <h2 id="adding-colors">Adding colors to my first creation</h2>
        <h5>April 12, 2024 - 5 PM</h5>
        <p>It's pink now! Although I had to paint the bread separately on a software called Substance Painter (this is not free).</p>
        
        <h2 id="complicated-feature">The most complicated feature on Blender, <em>I think</em></h2>
        <h5>April 12, 2024 - 9 PM</h5>
        <p>Time to make the sprinkles. Took me quite long, with a lot of issues. Basically I just need to make three cylinders, each one of those at different sizes. And then distribute them using weight paint and geometry nodes (which are two things I do bother explaining). But eventually I got it. Yay! By the way, the bread is now yellow with a slighty whiter part on the middle.</p>

        <h5>April 13, 2024</h5>
        <p>After some more tutorial videos, which is about setting up the environment and making a plate to put those donuts, I finally started "cooking" my donut... and whoosh, that's a long process!</p>
        <p>And here is my very first Blender artwork. Rendered by my laptop tirelessly for nine hours. I picked up the picture and saved it at 9 AM in the next day.</p>

        <h2 id="back-formore">Back for more</h2>
        <h5>April 17, 2024</h5>
        <p>I wanted to try making a landscape in Blender. And here it is, after some days of searching tutorials! This isn't super realistic though. By the way, I struggled a lot on how to make the sun glow...</p>
        <p>What kind of struggle? Well, Blender's compositor (aka image post-processor) has some bugs and I have to <em>manually</em> paint it in Photoshop. Took me some time to make it look nice.</p>

        <h2 id="third-time">Third time - slowly gaining experience!</h2>
        <h5>April 18, 2024</h5>
        <p>Didn't really take me long to find a seemingly easy tutorial this time. And yet it's another landscape scene, with a sun again! Water looks good, but the borders... hmm.</p>
        <p>This is rendered in multiple parts by separating them in different scenes and mixing everything together. I tried rendering all of them together (that image is already deleted), and the result was <em>horrible!</em></p>

        <p><em>Chill, this is the nice one.</em></p>
        
        <h2 id="artists">Something a lot of artists will have at some point</h2>
        <h5>April 19 - April 28, 2024</h5>
        <p>I'm not really an artist, but for some days, I had that feeling â€“ I suddenly don't know what I want to make. At that period, I looked for different tutorials but they all seemed boring. Actually I did make two black holes during that time: the first one does still have a render; the second one looks much more nicer but eventually got deleted because I messed up some volumetric (I don't wanna explain this word) issues.</p>
        <p>I actually put this render in my recycle bin. To me, it looks worse than a low-budget science fiction movie!</p>

        <h2 id="back-again">Back again after some breaks</h2>
        <h5>April 29, 2024</h5>
        <p>My nicest render so far in my opinion! It's a gas giant, but not Jupiter. Although there's <em>a lot</em> of details, it only took four hours to render.</p>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Brown_gas_giant.png" width="400">
        
        <h2 id="water-again">Alright, it's water again</h2>
        <h5>May 4, 2024</h5>
        <p>After some days of searching for tutorials and failed attempts again, I made this canyon. (Made on May the Fourth but nothing related to space...) Quite realistic this time! Except for the water, I think it's too bulgy.</p>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/05/Watery_canyon.png" width="400">
        
        <h2 id="blue-ball">The blue ball</h2>
        <h5>May 5, 2024</h5>
        <p>This one is made to be aesthetically pleasing. Good for a PC wallpaper, isn't it? Also this is not the Earth.</p>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/ff/Blue_Exoplanet.png" width="400">
        
        <h2 id="over">Temporarily over...</h2>
        <p>I was rendering stuffs again one night, with the lid closed. And when I went to check progress, the laptop shut down. I booted up again, then guess what? A blue screen! A scary <em id="blue"><strong>blue</strong></em> screen!</p>
        <p>So I did a quick Google search on my phone with its error code. The result: Windows can't boot up because of some random issues.</p>
        <p>On the next day, I went to tech room to hopefully find out what's wrong. There's even scarier stuff! My laptop's C drive is completely erased with nothing inside. Neither me or guys at tech room knows what happened. They simply told me that someone or "something" tried to get administrator rights before everything went away.</p>
        <p>And so my journey with Blender stopped at that point.</p>
        <p>Last thing, will I still continue doing this as my little hobby? I don't know.</p>
